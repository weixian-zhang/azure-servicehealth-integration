During planned maintenance on your Azure Database for PostgreSQL instance(s), there can be database server restarts or failovers, which might lead to brief (60-120 seconds) unavailability of the database servers for end users. The entire planned maintenance event including each server restarts is carefully monitored by the engineering team. The server failovers time is dependent on database recovery time, which can cause the database to come online in minutes to hours if you have high transactional activity on the server at the time of failover. To avoid longer unavailability time, it is recommended to keep transactional workload light and defer long-running transactions like create index or data load to minimize disruptions to your application.

Updates may have failed through the user interface as well as via APIs, between 19:00 UTC on 8 September 2024 and 04:40 UTC on 12 September 2024. Authentications were not impacted. While this issue impacted less than 15% of Microsoft Entra Permissions Management operations during this time period, unfortunately it impacted one or more of your Azure subscriptions. That’s why we’re providing you with this Post Incident Review (PIR) – to summarize what went wrong, how we responded, and the steps Microsoft is taking to learn from this and improve.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>What went wrong and why?</strong></p>\n<p>Updates to app configurations in Entra ID that targeted consumer apps failed to save to the backend. These updates are encrypted prior to being saved; however this process began failing because the encryption key that was being used had been revoked. Because there was no other available key to perform the encryption, these updates failed to save properly. This key revocation was a planned routine activity and was not due to any security incident.</p>\n<p><strong>How did we respond?</strong></p>\n<p>This incident was initially reported to us by an impacted customer, as our current monitoring did not include this scenario. The mitigation involved providing a new valid encryption key for Entra ID to utilize for saving app configurations for consumer apps. A new key was rolled out globally in a gradual fashion, and 99.9% of customers recovered within 6 hours. Full recovery was achieved about 24 hours later.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>How are we making incidents like this less likely or less impactful?</strong></p>\n<ul><li>We have repaired the process that provides the required encryption key to Entra ID, to avoid having keys revoked while still in use. (Completed)</li><li>We are updating our monitoring so that we are notified if the process that provides encryption keys is unhealthy. (Estimated completion: September 2024)</li><li>Finally, we are hardening this process to make it more resilient to issues that impact our encryption key handling. (Estimated completion: October 2024)</li></ul>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>How can customers make incidents like this less impactful?</strong></p>\n<p></p><ul><li>There was nothing that customers could have done to prevent or minimize impact from this specific incident.</li><li>More generally, consider evaluating the reliability of your applications using guidance from the Azure Well-Architected Framework and its interactive Well-Architected Review:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aka.ms/AzPIR/WAF\" target=\"_blank\">https://aka.ms/AzPIR/WAF</a></li><li>The impact times above represent the full incident duration, so are not specific to any individual customer. Actual impact to service availability varied between customers and resources – for guidance on implementing monitoring to understand granular impact:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aka.ms/AzPIR/Monitoring\" target=\"_blank\">https://aka.ms/AzPIR/Monitoring</a></li><li>Finally, consider ensuring that the right people in your organization will be notified about any future service issues – by configuring Azure Service Health alerts.

        "description": "<p><strong>What happened?</strong></p>\n<p>You were identified among a subset of Entra ID application customers trying to update application configurations that target consumer accounts, who may have experienced problems saving configuration changes. Updates may have failed through the user interface as well as via APIs, between 19:00 UTC on 8 September 2024 and 04:40 UTC on 12 September 2024. Authentications were not impacted. While this issue impacted less than 15% of Microsoft Entra Permissions Management operations during this time period, unfortunately it impacted one or more of your Azure subscriptions. That’s why we’re providing you with this Post Incident Review (PIR) – to summarize what went wrong, how we responded, and the steps Microsoft is taking to learn from this and improve.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>What went wrong and why?</strong></p>\n<p>Updates to app configurations in Entra ID that targeted consumer apps failed to save to the backend. These updates are encrypted prior to being saved; however this process began failing because the encryption key that was being used had been revoked. Because there was no other available key to perform the encryption, these updates failed to save properly. This key revocation was a planned routine activity and was not due to any security incident.</p>\n<p><strong>How did we respond?</strong></p>\n<p>This incident was initially reported to us by an impacted customer, as our current monitoring did not include this scenario. The mitigation involved providing a new valid encryption key for Entra ID to utilize for saving app configurations for consumer apps. A new key was rolled out globally in a gradual fashion, and 99.9% of customers recovered within 6 hours. Full recovery was achieved about 24 hours later.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>How are we making incidents like this less likely or less impactful?</strong></p>\n<ul><li>We have repaired the process that provides the required encryption key to Entra ID, to avoid having keys revoked while still in use. (Completed)</li><li>We are updating our monitoring so that we are notified if the process that provides encryption keys is unhealthy. (Estimated completion: September 2024)</li><li>Finally, we are hardening this process to make it more resilient to issues that impact our encryption key handling.
